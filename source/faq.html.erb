  <h1>Why go Big 4?</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col-desc">
      <p class="desc">We are well aware of the stigma that the Big 4 "works you to death." It's a smart tactic because that's the best way for smaller firms to retain their talent. In all honesty, it's a crap shoot. You can either get a great client with a great team and great hours, the absolute opposite, or somewhere in between. However, we'd bet that the majority of your managers, senior managers, and partners all came from Big 4 backgrounds. It's an experience you need to have in order to advance your career.</p>
